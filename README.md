# iaskirmish-data
Imperial Assault Data Project.  Includes JSON data and format specification.

All documentation for this project currently resides in the Wiki.

JSON files exist for deployments and command cards.  These can be used to pre-populate an army builder database, be used by a web app to provide data when hovering over text, or used to help create and display armys in streaming overlays.

In addition, Java libraries exist (or soon will) that can read and write the iaspec data specification.

# Applications
The following applications have said they will support the iaspecification
* X-Streamer - Xwing/Imperial Assault streaming overlay generator
* Tabletop Admiral - web based army builder for Imperial Assault skirmish armies.
* Imperial Assault Vassal Module - play skirmish online with your friends.

If you want to have your application listed here, please open issue and I'll get it added.
